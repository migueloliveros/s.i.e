Biography:

[s.i.e] acronym for space interactional experience is an interdisciplinary art, science and technology group whose key divulgative concern is to bring people, as mundane users of technology, "one step closer" to the immensity of the physical reality perceived through the limits of human knowledge/cognition.
The group, composed by seven members and open to collaboration, meet at MedialLab Prado Madrid and Google Campus. It has been active since Winter 2016.

Dr. Miguel Oliveros [Madrid, 1980]. BA (Hons), MRes, PhD. Associate professor at Universidad Nebrija.
Fine artist, researcher and programmer exploring the representation of the sublime and immaterial object/experience via new media technologies, such as, for example: reactive immersive audiovisual installations, emphasizing in open source languages and code. He has extensive experience in the form of commissions, patronages, collaborations and exhibitions in the creative industries & academia. He originally trained as an sculptor.

Pablo Méndez Zapardiel [Madrid, 1989]. His work spans many disciplines. He combines his knowledge as an architect with his passion around Art, Design and Technology. Aware that the future challenges go through learning how to solve complex situations, he works with multidisciplinary groups. Nowadays he develops innovation projects as a co-founder, trying to generate new experiences by using Art and Science.
Daniel Pérez Grande [Madrid, 1985]. BSc, MSc. Aerospace Engineer, currently pursuing a PhD on plasma physics for advanced Space propulsion. His main passion is Humanity’s exploration of Space and has strived to help popularize the science and engineering behind these incredible feats. More broadly, he is interested in the cross-sections between Science and the civil society, including Arts and Politics, and in the ever-fascinating discipline of Futurism.

Alejandro Serrano Zaera [1986- Madrid]. Frontend and backend programmer with training in graphic design and user experience. Fascinated by New Technologies and Technological Development Business with highly innovative content, using Agile development methodologies. 
 I love to gamify Solidarity Projects for ngo organizations, for that reason I created  “Gamification for a cause”, a non-profit organization that is primarily dedicated to training courses and gamify projects for ngos.

David Morante González [1991-Madrid] BSc, MSc. Aerospace Engineer, currently doing a PhD on Space Trajectory Optimization, developing new tools that could make interplanetary missions more affordable in terms of travel time or propellant consumed. He is fascinated by the cutting-edge technology developed by the space sector and willing to use this knowledge to help others.  He is also passionate about Astronomy and the mysteries of outer space.

Previous collaborators:

Sthef Folgar [Montevideo, 1986]. Visual artist working on the boundaries of known places and our perception of them, by creating images that breaks our references points. Master’s degree in contemporary photography and recently awarded with a grant to attend a Master of Arts, has worked in different photography, film and art installations projects. Currently has co-founded and works in a collective of artists focused on the development of visual projects. 

Celia Talamante [Madrid, 1988]; Telecommunications engineer, specialized in
sound and image. Currently working with open source code and object orientated programming, her interest centres on developing tools that generate real time, reactive visual environments. She collaborated in diverse artistic productions, giving technical support and has also developed her own performances. Nowadays, she combines artistic creation with her business, where she specializes in audiovisual installation and acoustic engineering.
